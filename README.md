# screenCapture

## What

Programme takes a screenshot and saves it to a folder ``./<month/year>`. If folder does not exist programme creates one.
User can name the screenshot or let it be named with DateTime.Now

## Why
Just to learn and maybe to help my grandmother. My grandmother wants to archive **every** receipt and bill. She used to print them out and put them in a folder. Teaching her to use SnippingTool and to organize files herself was an option :D
