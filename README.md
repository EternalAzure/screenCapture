# screenCapture

## What

The programme takes a screenshot and saves it to a folder `./<month/year>`. If the folder does not exist the programme creates one.
User can name the screenshot or let it be named with number of the day. All names will get random number suffix between 0-999.

## How

Download the zip and extract it. Move the `screenCapture.bat` to the folder you want to save your pictures. Run the `screenCapture.bat`. Windows will warn you about potential viruses. Do ignore. After you have run the `screenCapture.bat` `screenCapture.exe` is created to the same folder. I suggest pinning it to the taskbar and running it from there.

## Why
Just to learn some batch scripting and maybe to help out my grandmother. My grandmother wants to archive **every** receipt and bill. She used to print them out and put them in a paper folder. Teaching her to use SnippingTool and to organize files by herself was an option :D
